### To Do: 
----
- [ ] Code an implementation of the physionet left and right hand and rest physionet dataset that can be run consistently with stored weights. This should be a python script, that can run on console. 
- [ ] Create a comparable CNN example to demonstrate SOTA compared to standard. 
- [ ] There has to be an analysis of why training is so unstable. I will have to research "Dev Sets" to ensure consistent results
- [ ] Theoretical analysis of why GNNs work better for EEG analysis than normal CNN.
